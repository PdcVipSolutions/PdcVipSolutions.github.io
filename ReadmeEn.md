WorkSpaceManager also is represented as the integration of http-based backend and http-based frontend. This is the first step toward the applications based on the microservice ideas. 
    It has NO mullty-user functionality supported.
    It has NO reaction on the not started backend.
The main purp[ose was to get the list of tasks to be solved in the future.
